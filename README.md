Group Project to practice using vanilla JavaScript, external API calls and Express to make a C02 carbon footprint travel web app.

# Readme
Week 9 of CodeClan Professional Development award involved a JavaScript group project for the CodeClan programming course. 

## Team Anonymous Squirrel consisted of 
- Thomas Gracie (TGracie)
- Graham Stein (Graham-Stein)
- Caroline Graves (DeuterGraves)
- Kris Mac (krismac)

Using Agile Poker, we evaluated a range of proposed scenarios including a Game, a Carbon Tracker, an educational app or a stock tracker. We agreed that there was a opportunity for a carbon budget app driven by transport/route planning. 

The website should take in some input, and display the breakdown of the data in a graph.

##Specification
CodeClan instructors required that we establish a project to create an application in 4 days using core Javascript - no front-end frameworks or jQuery were allowed. 

Our trello/kanban dynamically compared our MoSCoW requirements with our backlog/work breakdown status.

# Development
We self organised around 4 sprints, focusing on particular features and functionality within the days. The days were kicked off with a stand-up to support retrospective and re-planning and closed our day with a huddle and code remerges. We took turns in being Scrum Master each day and regularly took turns to drive. 

Our first exercise involved a short burst of independent research followed by a brainstorming session to determine core functionality (MVP) and data sources/approaches. The remainder of sprint 1 involved agreeing user journey/requirements and work breakdown along with laying groundwork such as creating a workflow to support code management around Github.

## Technology used
- Javascript
- HTML/CSS
- Express 

## Life:Cycle Carbon Commute Planner 
- Making a small change & showing a difference 

```
You have been approached by a lifestyle consultancy company dealing with environmental sustainability. Your task is to build a personal CO2 planner app to help users calculates the impact of their commute on their CO2 footprint. The consultancy are seeking to encourage more users to cycle by showing a view of their current impact and the impact alternative modes of transport. 
```

## Features
- User entry of trips based on a daily commute.
- Input your weeks travel or model an ideal week. 
- Compare your carbon footprint.
- Plan a greener commute. 

## API, Libraries, Resources
- [Edinburgh Cycles](https://edinburghcyclehire.com/)
- [Google API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/)

## Update history
- v 0.1 MPV Release date 07/11/2018
- v 0.2 Extensions Release 08/11/2018

## Installing and running the app from Github
